# Project Description # 
This project creates a visualization of wild cat strikes that started in March in response to Covid-19. The visualization is in the same style of Maps generated to show the outbreaks of virus across the country with the intent to broadcast hope and express solidarity with those striking for better working conditions both during and after the pandemic. The relative size of the bubbles represent the relative size of the strikes happening and the different colors indicate broad categories of workers on strike. Visualization eventually used by Sunrise Movement.   

Data was pulled from   
https://paydayreport.com/covid-19-strike-wave-interactive-map/
at the end of April 2019 and the data used now is likely out of date.
